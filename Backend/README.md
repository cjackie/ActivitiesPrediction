# What is it
machine learning algorithms ralted code.
- `model_traning`, feature extraction. We used RBM.
- `index_construction`, make indexes of motions data, and perform clustering
- `variables_save`, parameters of our model. produced by running `train_model.py`
- `summaries`, training output to visualize the progress of training.
