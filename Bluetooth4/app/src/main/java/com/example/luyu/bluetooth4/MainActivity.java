        call the static getDefaultAdapter() method. This returns a BluetoothAdapter that represents
        the device's own Bluetooth adapter (the Bluetooth radio). There's one
        Bluetooth adapter for the entire system, and your application can interact with
        it using this object. If getDefaultAdapter() returns null, then the device does not
        support Bluetooth and your story ends here.*/

         Next, you need to ensure that Bluetooth is enabled. Call isEnabled() to
         check whether Bluetooth is currently enable. If this method returns false,
         then Bluetooth is disabled. To request that Bluetooth be enabled,
         call startActivityForResult() with the ACTION_REQUEST_ENABLE action Intent.

    /*Connecting as a client
   1. Using the BluetoothDevice, get a BluetoothSocket by calling createRfcommSocketToServiceRecord(UUID).
    This initializes a BluetoothSocket that will connect to the BluetoothDevice. The UUID passed
     here must match the UUID used by the server device when it opened its BluetoothServerSocket
     (with listenUsingRfcommWithServiceRecord(String, UUID)). Using the same UUID is simply a matter of
     hard-coding the UUID string into your application and then referencing it from both the server and client code.

   2. Initiate the connection by calling connect().
    Upon this call, the system will perform an SDP lookup on the remote device in order to match the UUID.
    If the lookup is successful and the remote device accepts the connection, it will share the RFCOMM channel to
    use during the connection and connect() will return. This method is a blocking call. If, for any reason, the connection
    fails or the connect() method times out (after about 12 seconds), then it will throw an exception.
    Because connect() is a blocking call, this connection procedure should always be performed in a thread separate
    from the main activity thread.
